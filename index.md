# PlayRho

Hello and welcome to the [PlayRho](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho) physics engine and library.
PlayRho started off as a fork of the Box2D 2.3.2 code written by Erin Catto.

Years ago I worked on developing a video game that involved physical interactions such as collisions between entities.
Not wanting to write a whole bunch of code for simulating physics if a library was already out there and ready to use, I found the Box2D library by Erin Catto and I was psyched!
It took me a little getting used to but in the end I was able to get it to do everything I needed it to do.

My warmest thanks to Erin for developing Box2D and making it available for us to use.

Years later, I returned to Box2D for another game I started work on and instead fell in love with changing the Box2D library.
At first this was just so I could use new features in C++14, but my work on the library grew to include many other changes including moving the fork off to its own repo and project name.

The project's [source code](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho) and
[API documentation](API/index.md) are available online.

Sincerely,

[Louis Langholtz](https://louis-langholtz.github.io)
