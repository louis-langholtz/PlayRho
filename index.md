# PlayRho

Hello and welcome to the [PlayRho](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho)
physics engine and library.
PlayRho started off as a fork of the Box2D 2.3.2 code
written by Erin Catto.

Years ago I worked on developing a video game that involved physical
interactions such as collisions between entities. Not wanting to write
a whole bunch of code for simulating physics if a library was already
out there and ready to use, I found the Box2D library by Erin Catto
and **WOW** was I psyched! It took me a little getting used to but in the
end I was able to get it to do everything I needed it to do.

My warmest thanks to Erin for developing Box2D and making it available
for us to use.

Years later, I returned to Box2D for another game I started work on
and instead fell in love with changing the Box2D library. At first this was
just so I could use new features in C++14, but my work on the library grew
to include many other changes including moving the fork off to its own repo
and project name.

The project's [source code](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho) is
available online. Its API documentation is also available online for the
following:
- [Release 1.1.0](API/1.1.0).
- [master branch](API/master).

Sincerely,

[Louis Langholtz](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/)
