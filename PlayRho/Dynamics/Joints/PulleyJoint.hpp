///   The pulley supports a ratio such that: length1 + ratio * length2 <= constant.
/// @note The force transmitted is scaled by the ratio.
/// @warning the pulley joint can get a bit squirrelly by itself. They often
///   work better when combined with prismatic joints. You should also cover the
///   the anchor points with static shapes to prevent one side from going to
///   zero length.
