/// @brief Real-number type.
///
/// @details This is the number type underlying numerical calculations conceptually involving
///   real-numbers. Ideally the implementation of this type doesn't suffer from things like:
///   catastrophic cancellation, catastrophic division, overflows, nor underflows.
///
/// @note This can be implemented using float, double, long double, Fixed64, or Fixed32
///   (though the use of Fixed32 is discouraged).
///
/// @note Regarding division:
///
///   While dividing 1 by a Real, caching the result, and then doing multiplications with the
///   result may well be faster (than repeatedly dividing), dividing 1 by Real can also result
///   in an underflow situation that's then compounded every time it's multiplied with other
///   values.
///
///   Meanwhile, dividing every value by Real isolates any underflows to the particular
///   division where underflow occurs.
///
/// @warning Using Fixed32 is not advised as it's numerical limitations are more likely to
///   result in problems like overflows or underflows.
/// @warning The note regarding division applies even more so when using a fixed-point type
///   (for Real).
